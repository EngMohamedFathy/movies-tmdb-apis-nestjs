# üöÄ NestJS Movies APIs - TMDB Integration

A scalable backend application built with **NestJS**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Redis** following modular design, and best coding practices.

### TMDB Integration & Movie Sync

This application integrates with **[TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)** to sync movies and genres into the local database.

####  Sync Methods

There are two ways to sync data from TMDB:

```
1. Manual Sync (triggered by Admin) call api (POST /api/admin/movies/tmdb/sync)
2. Automatic Sync (scheduled via Cron Job run every day at **3:00 AM** )
```

- (CRUD) After Syncing data you can make your actions on local database movies as you like.

## Features

- **NestJS** modular architecture (as a backend code)
- **PostgreSQL** via TypeORM (as a database)
- **Redis** for caching (as a caching system)
- **APIs Security** via JWT auth (and ready for Role-based Access Control)
- **Clean folder structure** by applying Software Design Principles & Design Patterns

### üîß Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EngMohamedFathy/movies-tmdb-apis-nestjs.git
cd your-nestjs-project
```

2. Start the application using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

3. Once the containers are running, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080/api
```

This will open the **Swagger UI** to explore the API documentation.

---

### üîß APIs Documentation
- The API endpoints are grouped in Swagger as follows:
- Or Use Postman collection is included in the project:
  - (TMDB APIs [nestjs].postman_collection.json)

```
üìÅ Client Authentication
  - POST /api/client/auth/register
  - POST /api/client/auth/login

üìÅ Admin Authentication
  - POST /api/admin/auth/login

üìÅ Client APIs
  - GET /api/client/movies
  - GET /api/client/movies/{slug}
  - POST /api/client/movies/watchlist
  - POST /api/client/movies/rating

üìÅ Admin APIs
  - POST /api/admin/movies
  - GET /api/admin/movies
  - GET /api/admin/movies/{id}
  - PUT /api/admin/movies/{id}
  - DELETE /api/admin/movies/{id}
  - POST /api/admin/movies/tmdb/sync
  
üìÅ Lookups APIs
  - GET /api/lookups/genres
```

> You can test each endpoint directly from the Swagger interface using JWT tokens after login.

### üë• User Roles & Authentication

The system supports two types of users:

```
1. Admin
2. Client
```

Each user type has a set of secured APIs, and some public APIs are accessible without authentication.

You can use the following test accounts to authenticate and get JWT tokens for secured endpoints:

```
Admin User
Email:    admin@email.com
Password: 123456

Client User
Email:    client@email.com
Password: 123456
```
```
Key:   Authorization
Value: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

### ‚ö° Redis Caching Strategy
- We applied cache system by using Strategy Design Pattern.
- To improve performance and reduce database load, Redis caching is applied to some **highly-used public APIs**.

These APIs are frequently accessed by many users, so caching helps to:

- Reduce repeated database queries
- Improve response times
- Scale efficiently under high traffic

```
Caching is applied on the following public endpoints:

1. GET /api/client/movies
   - Cache Key: movies::filters::{filter_string}

2. GET /api/client/movies/{slug}
   - Cache Key: movies::slug::{slug}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Cache is automatically **cleared** when related movie data is updated. The next request will regenerate and store the updated response in cache.
